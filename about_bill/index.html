    <h2> Where I came from</h2>
    <p> I grew up in rural Illinois and did my undergrad studies at 
    <a href='http://www.eiu.edu' target="_blank">
      Eastern Illinois University
    </a>,
    getting degrees in
    <a href="http://www.eiu.edu/~math" target="_blank">
      Mathematics
    </a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.eiu.edu/~physics" target="_blank">
      Physics
    </a>
    and overall having a great time.</p>
    
    <p>While at EIU, I worked with Professor Leo Comerford of the Mathematics department
    on a departmental honors project studying hyperbolic groups, and during the summer
    of my Junior year, I went to the
    <a href="http://www.rochester.edu" target="_blank">
      University of Rochester
    </a>
    on an NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) grant to work with
    <a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/" target="_blank">
      Professor Eric Blackman
    </a>
    to model the formation of jets in magnetized accretion disks.</p>

    <h2> Where I am </h2>
    <p>After four years at EIU, I moved to my current position sunny Santa Barbara,
    CA to pursue a Ph. D. in Physics. Currently I'm working with 
    <a href='http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/bildsten' target="_blank">
      Lars Bildsten
    </a>
    to model accreting white dwarfs in various configurations. The main tool I
    use is Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, or 
    <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
      MESA
    </a>
    as it is usually called.</p>
    
    <p>
      I also work with
      <a href="http://dahowell.com" target="_blank">
        Andy Howell
      </a>
      on detecting superluminous supernovae in the 
      <a href="http://cfht.hawaii.edu/SNLS/" target="_blank">
        SNLS
      </a>
      dataset.
