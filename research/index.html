    <h2>Accreting White Dwarfs</h2>
    <p>
      My primary research while at UCSB has been on the various ways white
      dwarf stars react when they accrete matter from a companion. A large
      fraction (roughly one third) of stars form in binary systems. As a result,
      a star's binary compaion can affect its evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a star that's not too massive (perhaps up to several times the mass
      of the sun) runs out of nuclear fuel, it sheds its outer layers, leaving
      behind a very hot, earth-sized object called a white dwarf that is
      of such tremendous density that the primary pressure preventing it from
      further collapse is that from electron's wave functions not wanting to
      overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if a white dwarf has a binary companion, it is possible that due to
      the winds or just a spillover of material from expansion as it evolves,
      the compaion can donate matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, either
      by direct accretion or more likely through an accretion disk. What happens
      to that matter once it makes its way to the surface of the white dwarf
      depends on the mass of the white dwarf, the composition of the material,
      and the temperature of the white dwarf. These outcomes are the primary
      focus of my research.
    </p>
    <h4>Outcome 1: Steady Burner</h4>
    <p>
      For a given mass white dwarf accreting solar-like material from a
      compaion, there is a narrow range of accretion rates that allow for the
      material to be burned at the same rate it is being accreted. In such a
      configuration, The matter can be thought to arrive at the surface of the
      white dwarf, pass through a thin (~10<sup>-7</sup> M<sub>âŠ™</sub>)
      hydrogen-rich layer before reaching the burning layer, where it is
      processed into nearly pure helium at a temperature of around
      10<sup>8</sup> K. These steady-state burners are still compact objects, 
      but are prodigiously luminous, burning at nearly 10,000 times the 
      luminosity of the sun. As such, they are remarkably hot, with effective
      temperatures ranging from 100,000 K to 1,000,000 K. Being so hot, they 
      emit strongly in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray. This, along with their 
      original mode of discovery gives them their more common name, 
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersoft_x-ray_source'>
        supersoft sources
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      In my work, I have used the computational tool
      <a href='http://mesa.sourceforge.net'>MESA</a> to find the accretion rates
      that allow for this outcome as well as the resulting structure of thse
      objects. I continue to study them to understand what the fate of the 
      growing helium layer under the burning layer is as well as how that may
      affect the long-term mass growth or decay of the objects, as they are
      speculated to be one channel towards producing a 
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_Supernova'>
        Type Ia supernova
      </a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Outcome 2: Nova</h4>
    <p>
      If the accreting matter is too deficient in hydrogen or it is accreting
      too slowly, it arrives on the white dwarf cold and instead accumulates
      with little to no hydrogen burning. After a sufficiently large envelope
      has accumulated, the pressure at the base of the freshly accreted layer
      becomes high enough to initiate unstable burning that is much more
      vigorous than that in the steady burning case. This rapid injection of
      energy into the thin outer envelope drives a convective wave through the
      accumulated layer, which in turn drives the radius of the white dwarf
      to expand dramatically, cooling the outer layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this now engorged and highly luminous state, the white dwarf becomes
      about as luminous as the steady state burner, but since it is so much
      cooler, we can observe it easily with optical telescopes both in the 
      Milky Way and in nearby galaxies like M31. This state is a nova
      outburst, where the expanded white dwarf is bright in the optical and is
      typically observed to drive a wind, blowing off much of the material it
      had built up before it can be burned. After the envelope mass has been
      reduced by mass loss to a sufficiently small mass, it shrinks back down
      to a more supersoft source-like state, where it burns its remnant envelope
      quasi-stably for days to years before finally extinguishing and returning
      to its accreting state.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research concerning the nova outcome has focused on finding what 
      recurrence times (times between nova outbursts) arise from various 
      combinations of white dwarf mass and accretion rate of solar-like
      material. This is important since measuring a recurrence time of tens of
      years is typically assumed to indicate a massive white dwarf and a
      possible progenitor system for a type Ia supernova or accretion-induced
      collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally I've done extensive work characterizing the 
      supersoft phase of the nova after outburst, attempting to use
      measurements of this phase to constrain the progenitor system. Most
      recently, collaborators working with the 
      <a href="http://www.ptf.caltech.edu/iptf/">
        Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory
      </a>
      discovered and analyzed the quickest-recurring nova known, which goes off
      in M31 about once every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently I've been working with collaborators to better understand
      how the supersoft phase after outburst could affect the radio observations
      of novae long after their optical peak. This work is ongoing.
