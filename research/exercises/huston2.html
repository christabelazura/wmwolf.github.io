<h2> Background: The Virial Theorem </h2>
<p>
  The Virial theorem states:
  \[2E_{\rm th} = -E_{\rm grav}\]
  where
  \[E_{\rm th} = \frac{3}{2}NkT\]
  is the total thermal energy in the star (<var>N</var> is the total number of particles in the star, <var>k</var> is Boltzmann's constant, and <var>T</var> is the typical temperature of particles in the star, which is likely similar to the core temperature). The term on the right side of the Virial theorem is the gravitational potential energy:
  \[E_{\rm grav} = -f\frac{GM^2}{R}\]
  where <var>f</var> is some constant close to 1 that depends on the detailed structure of the star (we could compute it for the constant density model if we really wanted to via
  \[E_{\rm grav} = -\int_0^R\frac{GM(r)dm}{r}\]
  since we have the density in a simple form). I recommend reviewing the proof of this in the stellar structure notes, chapter 3. A piece of background you might be missing is the relation of the pressure and temperature of ideal gases:
  \[P = \frac{\rho kT}{\mu m_p}\qquad E_{\rm th} = \frac{3}{2}NkT = \frac{3}{2}PV\]

<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p>
  R Cor Bor (<emph>Arr-Core-Bore</emph>) are a bizarre type of star that appears to be predominantly made of helium with significant carbon enhancement.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Assuming the mass fraction of helium, <var>Y</var>, is 0.8, and the mass fraction of carbon-12, <var>X<sub><sup>12</sup>C</sub></var>, is 0.2, calculate the mean molecular weight, &mu; of this star.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume a constant density for the star, \(\rho(r) = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3}\), where <var>M</var> is the total stellar mass and <var>R</var> is the total stellar radius. Use the Virial theorem to solve for the typical temperature of a star with mass <var>M</var>, radius <var>R</var>, and mean molecular weight <var>&mu;</var>. Express your answer scaled to solar units. That is, it should be in the form of
    \[T = (\textrm{some temperature in Kelvin})\left(\frac{R}{R_\odot}\right)^a\left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^b\left(\frac{\mu}{0.63}\right)^c\]
    For some constants <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and <var>c</var>. Note also the \(\odot\) symbol means "of the sun".
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the typical temperature for an R Cor Bor star of radius 2 times greater than the sun's, and a mass that is 1.5 times the sun's.
  </li>
</ol>
