<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p>A useful (albeit not terribly realistic) model for a homogenous composition star may be obtained by assuming that the density is a linear funciton of radius. Thus, assume that

\[\rho(r) = \rho_c(1-r/R)\]

where \(\rho_c\) is the central density and \(R\) is the total radius where we may assume zero boundary conditions for pressure and temperature: \(P(R)=T(R)=0\).

<ol>
  <li>
    Find an expression for the central density in terms of \(R\) and \(M\). You will have to use the mass equation: \[dM_r/dr=4\pi r^2\rho(r)\].
  </li>
  <li>
    Use hydrostatic equilibrium (\(dP/dr = -\rho(r)g(r)\)) and the zero boundary conditions to find the pressure as a function of radius. Your answer will be in the form of \(P(r) = P_c\times (\textrm{polynomial in }r/R)\). What is \(P_c\) in terms of \(M\) and \(R\)? (It should be proportional to \(GM^2/R^4\).) Express \(P_c\) numerically with \(M\) and \(R\) in solar units. That is, your pressure should be of the form of [some pressure] \(\times (M/M_\odot)^2(R/R_\odot)^{-4}\).
  </li>
